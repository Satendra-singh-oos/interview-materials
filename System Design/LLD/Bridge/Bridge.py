# Bridge Desing Pattern -   The bridge pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to separate an object's interface from its implementation, so that the two can vary independently. This is useful when you have an object that has two or more characteristics that can vary independently, and you want to be able to change one without affecting the other.

# Circles and squares
# Each can be rendered in vector or raster form
